### About The Project
A partial replication of the official SATS ELIXIA training app (that can be found on [the Google Play store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sats.sats)). 

It was made during a six week SCRUM project, and is based on design documents and functional requirements that were provided to us by the developers of the original application, Apegroup.
